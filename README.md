# Plan

This is a hybrid planning tool that combines task tracking with timing keeping.

With these two sources of information and a rating of effort its possible to dynamically determine rate of completion.

## Problem

Complex creative projects with know unknowns and unknown unknowns are notoriously tough to estimate completion or predict sticking point.

Completion estimates are essential to determine project resource requirements.

Little foresight into sticking points and time crunch areas leads to too little too late task prioritization triage.

## Solution Goal

Give small teams the peace of mind in taking on complex projects.

The software requires an account of upcoming task, effort rating, and task completion duration. This account will only be as accurate the engineer, pm, or inventor can recall or predict. With all of this information a rate of progress or "velocity" can be calculated from actual duration and predicted effort. From there the velocity figure can be applied to all future task in the pipe. Thus showing when task will be done drawn into real time windows of work capacity. Like 8 hour days 5 days a week or 2 hour sessions 3 days a week for instance. Similarly actual and predicted time window data can narrow the predictions with-in more realistic parameters.

This solution in its inception will be focused on the resource of time. In the future the concept might lend itself to help manage other resources such as money, energy, or materials. The span of accounting from plans to actions could integrate nicely into other types of projections. For instance, consider software services. It can be known when those services will be needed in the plan. It can also be projected when the project might become viable. Taking both into consideration could give an estimated start-up cost on these types of products pre-revenue. In simpler terms, upfront cost of non-time resources could also be projected. Budgets on those resources like due dates could foresee snags and hold ups.

## Drawn from solutions

Agile Software Development principals around calculating velocity instead of ask engineers for times estimates is a big inspiration to the concept.

Kanban board style apps was an inspiration to the idea of drag and drop prioritization.

Billable time accounting apps and their lack of budgeting features were an inspiration to thinking about the problem more deeply.
