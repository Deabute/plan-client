## Inspiration

Kanban board-style apps were an inspiration to the idea of drag and drop prioritization and initial auto-assignment of budget.

Billable time accounting apps and their lack of budgeting features were an inspiration for building this app at the very least as a back scratcher.

After all my problem wasn't tracking billable time, it was having the anxiety that I needed to be doing something productive every moment of the day.

Modern financial budgeting tools and the impact they've had in our life has been an inspiration for applying the same principles to time.

Just a tip from a dilettante: When every dollar has an agreed job, it's easier to sleep at night.

### Special Copyright note from the author

I'm a big fan of open source and what it's done for our world.
However, it's come to light in some recent years that there is some disregard maybe even ignorance for the spirit of what open source is.
In some cases, scrupulous parties take advantage of the Open Source Initiative's "no discrimination" definitions to snipe value away from original Authors and capitalize it solely for themselves.
I think even restrictive licenses are just an interpretation of the spirit of Open Source Software.
Ultimately if someone wants to violate the goodwill behind the spirit of one of these licenses they will.
Just as someone might violate copyright without any license at all.

All that being said, I want to make it clear in plain words what I intended to provide licensees.

- Ability to audit the source that gets run on their computer.
- The opportunity to repair and augment code that gets run on their computer.
- Ability to share improved code freely
- Ability to pick up the torch upon author abandonment

Things I do not intend to provide anyone (Complete product-wise). Licensees or not.

- Ability to copycat, rebadge, and capture the same market segment
  - Individually none of those things are all that concerning. Stand-alone they are either part of open source or business. However, to see it all happen to a project in concert by a competitor with just a bit more marketing power or funding is a threat to this ecosystem in general.
- modifying the code for the purposes of unlawful acts

Keep in mind the software is constantly improving and I can change the license at any time to solely serve members of our community either contributors or users. Violating "the spirit" of open source is legal, violating copyright is prosecutable in my jurisdiction. Keep in mind laws spell out the rights of authorship more than they explain how a license should be interpreted. The dirty secret of open source is that the licenses are easy to enforce because of the power authorship has.

Thanks for understanding,
Paul Beaudet
