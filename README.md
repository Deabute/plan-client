# Time Intent Beta

Busy? Tell your time where it goes.

Work hard without sacrificing the finer points of life.

Time Intent is a tool for setting intentions for your time armed with the tools to fulfill those intentions. Prioritize, organize, track, budget and give times to accomplish intents.

## Problems that might lead one to use this tool

- Being unsure where the time goes
- Anxious about personal productivity
- Talking about work or working unnecessarily long hours negatively affects relationships
- It's hard to remember appointments and keep to basic routines when busy or engaging in a complex project
- Breaking down and identifying the most important part of a task to work on is difficult
- Maintaining consistent habits is tough when starting with too much, too frequent, or too many different habits.

## Solution Goal

Give an individual peace of mind in taking on ambitious projects in balance with other parts of a fulfilling life.

One has a finite amount of time in the day. "Time Intent" shows how time gets used and gives the ability to set goals for how time will be used.

## Inspiration

Kanban board-style apps were an inspiration to the idea of drag and drop prioritization and initial auto-assignment of budget.

Billable time accounting apps and their lack of budgeting features were an inspiration for building this app at the very least as a back scratcher.

After all my problem wasn't tracking billable time, it was having the anxiety that I needed to be doing something productive every moment of the day.

Modern financial budgeting tools and the impact they've had in our life has been an inspiration for applying the same principles to time. When married and sharing finances, every dollar having an agreed job means it's easier to sleep at night.

### Special Copyright note from the author

I'm a big fan of open source and what it's done for our world.
However, it's come to light in some recent years that there is some disregard maybe even ignorance for the spirit of what open source is.
In some cases, scrupulous parties take advantage of the Open Source Initiative's "no discrimination" definitions to snipe value away from original Authors and capitalize it solely for themselves.
I think even restrictive licenses are just an interpretation of the spirit of Open Source Software.
Ultimately if someone wants to violate the goodwill behind the spirit of one of these licenses they will.
Just as someone might violate copyright without any license at all.

All that being said, I want to make it clear in plain words what I intended to provide licensees.

- Ability to audit the source that gets run on their computer.
- The opportunity to repair and augment code that gets run on their computer.
- Ability to share improved code freely
- Ability to pick up the torch if there is such a time when I am unable to continue the project.

Keep in mind the software is constantly improving and I can change the license at any time to solely serve members of our community either contributors or users. Violating "the spirit" of open source is legal, violating copyright is prosecutable in my jurisdiction. Keep in mind laws spell out the rights of authorship more than they explain how a license should be interpreted. The dirty secret of open source is that the licenses are easy to enforce because of the power authorship has.

Thanks for understanding,
Paul Beaudet
