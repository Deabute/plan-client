## Note about discharge types

Employees of Deabute and contributors to the project are bond to a code of conduct.
One requirement being to only speak positively of former colleagues.
Whether a discharge is honorable or not is up to either the contributor's mentor, supervisor or themselves.
We require adequate notice and responsibility hand-offs for honorable self-discharge.
A plain discharge could be issued for a simple lack of fit and is not a character comment on the individual.
Honorable discharge practically means that we would take request for recommendation and potentially consider reinvolvement in the future.
We do not take request for recommendation on plain discharges please see their commit history.
