# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs for short)

Last edit 12/6/2021

The purpose of a KPI is to have a measured indication of whether an effort is successful or not.

In this case "Plan" has a handful of goals that need to be distilled to one detectable metric.

- Tracking time gives user insight into potential improvement for behavior or habit changes
- The ability to budget time gives user a way to measure their projected improvement
- Instead of focusing on a completion vs creation ratio its more important users can see the big picture of project results vs life balance
- If our user is typically disorganized, do they see measured improvements in their organization skills?
- Do our users feel they have agency over their own personal data?

Questions to narrow down a sole metric

- What is the ultimate problem being solved?
  - The feeling one's own time is outside their control.
- What is potentially the most important differentiator between Plan and similar tools?
  - Its less a report of what happened with ones time and more a directive as to what to do with their time
  - Zero based time accounting. The tool is for self directing every aspect of ones life, not just areas of productivity.
- What has Plan proven to help with in its current case studies
  - Organization: remembering appointments, bills, establishing regular routines: Result not dissimilar to other task tracking tools
  - Realistic self-awareness of how long routine task take: Not unlike other tracking methods
  - The first two aforementioned benefits on their own provide little value add over other tools but together increase use compliance. In turn giving more detailed insight into tracked behavior
  - Less stress about size of ambitions: This may just be a result of discipline with our participant
- What does Plan struggle to deliver on in its current state
  - Data integrity: Sync sometimes fails to accurately replicate things like due dates (Technical Barrier)
  - Re-Budgeting Compliance: Sticking to a plan is visual easy to measure, allocating time fractions is problematic from a technical and practical use perspectives (UX, Social)

Since budgeting goals are such a core component of controlling one's own time whether those set goals were hit or not is a good indicator of the following

- Time being tracked
- Goals being set
- Goals becoming completed

Rate goals being completed lining up with set goal would be a good indicator of the following

- No lagging indication of potential completion of a goal
- Time tracked
- Goals becoming completed

Continuous time tracking would be a good indicator of the following

- App use
- Tracking compliance

Frequency of budget adjustment would be a good indicator of

- App use
- Goal setting

Of the options listed appropriate rate of completion seems to be the best measure

Things to understand about appropriate rate of completion

- this data is still private to our users because of the nature of how the data is stored.
- Sharing of the data will have to be opt-in.
- This measure can also be used to measure a users own success with the product
  - in this way it can be a viable part of the product
  - in this way business and use interest lines up
